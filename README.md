#The Weather Journal App
## Dependencies : node.js    express    body-parser   cors

## this app uses two APIs the Geocoding and the current weather data.

## we use the geocoding api to get the coordinates using the zip code
## then we use the current weather data api to get the information about the weather using the coordinates we got

## after that we take the data recieved from the api in addition to data from user and post it to the server

## then we retrieve the data from the server to update the DOM
